# Flappy Bird BOT

This is an AI bot that learns to play the game Flappy Bird by itself. It use the [NEAT](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) module in python to achieve this. Apart from this module, I have also used pygame to actually make the Flappy Bird game itself.

[Online Deployment for running the application in your browser](https://replit.com/@notkshitijsingh/neat-flappy-bird?v=1)

# Installation

1. Download the code in a ZIP format and unzip it in a folder of your choice.
2. Open Terminal and install neat-python and pygame modules.


```bash
  pip install pygame
  pip install neat-python
  python main.py
```
3. Run the main.py file.


## Working

This uses the position of the bird and the position of the pipes to form neural networks using NEAT. If you do not understand it, it's basically like Darwin's Natural selection where many generations are created with the best traits passed on till a perfect bot is achieved.
